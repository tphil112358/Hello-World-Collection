# Overview

A fun project to collect Hello Worlds in every langauge I know how to code in. It would be easy to
grind out every existing language in an afternoon, but that isn't what I want to do. I want to add a
Hello World here with each language I have made useful, complex and published code for. I plan
also to implement a test runner than automates the process of running all of the Hello Worlds.

Description: Prints the classic "Hello World!" to the screen.
