# Overview

A fun project to collect Hello Worlds in every language I can code in. It would be easy to grind out every existing language 
in an afternoon, but rather I will add a Hello World here with each language for which I have at least one published project.

Description: Prints the classic "Hello World!" to the screen.

The repo so far contains:
    Python

* [Every real language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

* [Every Esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list)
