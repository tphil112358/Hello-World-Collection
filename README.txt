# Overview

A fun project to collect Hello Worlds in every langauge I know how to code in. It would be easy to
grind out every existing language in an afternoon, but I want to add a Hello World
here with each language I have published projects for.

Description: Prints the classic "Hello World!" to the screen.

The repo so far contains:
    Python

* [Every real language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

* [Every Esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list)
